## About

Hello! So, I have been feeling a little out-of-touch at the Makerspace and more importantly with making. Earlier in my undergraduate degree, I spent some time looking at the courses different Makerspaces across the world offer and charted out a course that we were to offer. In this time of "crisis", I am going back to my notes and running that course for myself. Feel free to join in as I do this! Here is a rough outline of the same:

- Week 1: Introduction to Making: Let people mess around, work with thermocol boards, cardboard tape, encourage different media, paints, yarns, waste parts. Complement this with a holistic walk-around of the makerspace, name machines, show what they can do, some things that have been made. The idea is to spark interest and imagination. Let’s also make sure whatever they make in this week, they can take back - this might be a good idea in general.

- Week 2: First Step of Prototyping: Bring in the design skills from the roster - sketching, basics of ED, CAD, CAM, PDS. Also talk about best ways to measure things/use measuring tools. Take away: One CAD model they want to 3D print, a CAM thingy, and PDS pattern they can sew 

- Week 3: Safety Module I with guided usage of machines

- Week 4 and Week 5: 3D printing, Laser-Cutting/CNC, Sewing Machines: Use these weeks to familiarize them with the machines and produce the designs they had created earlier. They can iterate over and over and print, cut, sew multiple things and (with a specified constraint) the world can be their oyster.
 
- Week 6 and 7: Working with Microcontrollers: Walk them through what a microcontroller is and over the next two weeks have them MAKE A basic instructable project with a MCU and some sensors/ LEDs/ Motors with maybe something they made earlier in the course . Guide them through it. 

- Week 8: Safety Module II with guided usage of machines

- Week 9 and 10: Woodworking: Have them work with wood working tools - essentially heavy machinery. Start with screws, nuts, bolts, conventions, using hammers, drills and whatnots (maybe introduce it like a rage room session where you start the session by hammering). End with a small build thing?

**Project month begins**

- Week 10: Identify a University Client and an associated problems followed by a discussion on open source, making as an antithesis to capitalism + accessibility + classist and casteist notions associated with making in the Indian context

- Week 11: Associated solutions with some constraints on the part being used and ideated upon and have the designs ready 
- Week 12 and Week 13: low-fidelity prototypes? Base for further work and possibility that others can take up if interested or them in the summer as a side thing?


## Resources

**Week 1**

For this week, I will be working with cardboard, ice-cream sticks, paints, thermocol, and other similar supplies to be able to channel the child-like creativity that comes out in a playground. The idea is to have fun, think, and honestly let loose. Making is so often guarded behind softwares and machines and things to pick up, and while that is needed sometimes one forgets that the fulfillment that drives making can be accessible even without these guardrails.

Here is some material to go through before you begin:
