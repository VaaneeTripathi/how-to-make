# How to Make Stuff

At this point, this website is a documentation of how I am learning to make stuff at the Makerspace at my University. This is a course I am running for myself. It is inspired by a collection of 20+ universities around the world and their makerspaces' courses for undergraduate students. This is me trying to run one!
