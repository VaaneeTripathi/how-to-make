## Course outline

The course aims to get people through the basic skills one can learn at the Makerspace. Now, there can always be a debate about what else should make the cut and what shouldn't, but that is a frivolous argument. It doesn't matter all that much. The idea here is to get one accustomed to the lay of the land. Having spent some time at the space and also having looked at the courses different places use, I do think that this however is a structured and comprehensive way to go about starting yourself at a Makerspace. Here is how it goes:

**Week 1: Introduction to Making**

Get messy. Work with thermocol, cardboard, tape, paint, yarn, and scrap materials. Complement this with a guided walkthrough of the makerspace—we'll name machines, show what they do, and explore past projects. The goal: spark imagination and curiosity. *Take-away: Something you made with your hands that you can take home.*

**Week 2: First Steps of Prototyping**

Now we build the foundation for design. Learn sketching basics, engineering drawing (ED), CAD fundamentals, CAM concepts, and pattern drafting (PDS). We'll also cover measuring techniques and best practices. *Take-aways: A CAD model ready to 3D print, a CAM file, and a sewing pattern you designed.*

**Week 3: Safety Module I**

Guided, hands-on introduction to makerspace machines with a focus on safe practices and best techniques.

### Making & Creating

**Weeks 4–5: 3D Printing, Laser-Cutting/CNC & Sewing**

Put your designs to work. Spend these weeks familiarizing yourself with the machines and producing the designs from Week 2. Iterate, print, cut, and sew multiple versions. With some constraints as guides, you're free to explore. *Take-away: A portfolio of 3–5 physical prototypes.*

**Weeks 6–7: Microcontrollers & Electronics**

Demystify microcontrollers. Over two weeks, you'll build a functional project combining an MCU with sensors, LEDs, or motors—ideally incorporating something you made earlier in the course. *Take-away: A working electronics project and foundational knowledge for future builds.*

**Week 8: Safety Module II**

Dive deeper into safety for advanced machines—preparation for woodworking and heavier equipment.

**Weeks 9–10: Woodworking**

Welcome to the heavy machinery side of making. Start with fundamentals: screws, nuts, bolts, conventions, and hand tools like hammers and drills. (Could even start with a "rage room" session—there's something therapeutic about driving a nail.) Build toward a small woodworking project. *Take-away: Practical skills and a wooden object you designed and built.*

### Project Phase

**Week 10: Problem Identification & Context**

Identify a real problem at the university—a client, a need, an opportunity. Alongside this, we'll discuss open-source principles, making as a counter to consumerism, and the accessibility and social dimensions of making in the Indian context.

**Week 11: Solutions & Design**

Ideate solutions within defined constraints. Finalize designs and create detailed plans for prototyping.

**Weeks 12–13: Low-Fidelity Prototyping**

Build functional prototypes to test your ideas. These don't need to be perfect—they're foundations for iteration. If you don't continue the project, others might pick it up or refine it in the summer.

### Philosophy

This structure balances breadth and depth. You'll touch many tools, build real competence in several, and leave with both skills and tangible projects. Most importantly, you'll understand how to learn, iterate, and make—which transfers to anything you build next. Note that at no point is this course going to tell you what projects to do o rgive you any sort of templates. I will add what projects I did but that is merely an example. Try to make things that excite you, that are fun in your context and excite YOU, even if it means building a toy or a harry potter inspired wand!
