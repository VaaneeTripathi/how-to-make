## How to do the course

So the best way to do this would be to go in order, however if you feel like at a certain point you want to pick up skill A before skill B, be my guest. There is nothing wrong with that. Like I said, no wrong way to learn. 

Each week will come with some material to go through. Now these can take the form of articles, blogs, tutorials, youtube videos, papers, reports, and maybe something else. These will serve one or multiple of these following purposes:

1. To actually learn a skill or a software
2. To complement the skill with theoretical background I think should come with it
3. To open one's mind about the possibilities
4. To inform one of the history, the context, and/or the philosophy
5. To present best practices when doing a certain thing

The idea is to look at these things not just as tools or individual skills but to develop a more whole and comprehensive view and understanding of the same. This will allow one to build more conscientiously, more mindfully and result in thought-out, good, responsible work. 

Having said that, some of the material can be considered optional and if it is feeling too much, you can go ahead without going through all of it. But if you are able, I would highly reccommend going through the material in its entirety.
