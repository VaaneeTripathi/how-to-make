## Author

Hi, I’m Vaanee!

I’m a senior at Ashoka University majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Creative Writing. I create technology that’s accessible to everyone and enhances people’s quality of life. My work focuses on inclusive design and assistive technology – because I believe great tech should work for all of us, not just some of us.

Recently, I’ve been diving deep into curating accessible educational experiences for individuals with visual impairments and creating inclusive digital experiences. When I’m not coding or researching, you’ll find me at the university Makerspace building things with everything from electronics to fabrics. In my spare time, I also write, crochet, and make art.

Interested in collaborating or just want to chat about any of these things? Feel free to reach out!
