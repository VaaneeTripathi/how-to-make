# Week 2: First Step of Prototyping

Welcome to Week 2! This week focuses on building foundational design and prototyping skills that every maker needs—from concept ideation and sketching to CAD modeling, CAM machining, and pattern design sewing (PDS). Now, note that this section is going to be slightly information-heavy and can be overwhelming. Make sure you do this at your own pace. How long you take is not important, how you engage with the content is. Can't engage if you're stressed!

## What You Will Learn

- Principles that guide effective prototyping
- Essential sketching techniques for product design
- The engineering design process: a step-by-step approach to solving problems creatively
- Key skills in CAD, CAM, and PDS tools with curated tutorials
- Developing a maker mindset: embracing iteration and learning from failure

## 1. Basics of Engineering Design Process

Engineering design is a systematic, cyclical method to solve problems by creating solutions that meet users' needs.

- **Understand:**  
  The typical stages are:  
  1. **Define the Problem**  
  2. **Brainstorm Solutions**  
  3. **Plan and Sketch**  
  4. **Create the Prototype**  
  5. **Test and Evaluate**  
  6. **Iterate and Improve**

- **Read:** [A Deep Dive into Engineering Design Principles and Methodology](https://www.cambridge-dt.com/a-deep-dive-into-engineering-design-principles-and-methodology/)  
  [Introduction to Prototyping in Engineering Design (Viva Pressbooks)](https://viva.pressbooks.pub/introegrdesign/chapter/prototype/)  
  These resources explain how engineering design ensures functionality, manufacturability, safety, and usability.

## 2. Principles of Prototyping

Prototyping is about learning early and learning often. Good prototypes are rough, fast, and focused on answering specific questions.

- **Read:** [IDEO’s 7 Principles to Guide Your Prototyping](https://www.ideo.com/journal/7-principles-to-guide-your-prototyping)  
  Key takeaways include starting rough, adding refinement selectively, embracing pivots, leveraging existing parts, documenting thoroughly, and remembering your prototype’s purpose: to learn and improve.

## 3. Sketching for Design

Sketching is one of the fastest ways to externalize and communicate your ideas. It helps you understand form, function, and user interactions early in the design process.

- **Explore:** [10 Essential Sketching Techniques for Product Design (i-MAS)](https://i-mas.com/en/10-essential-sketching-techniques-for-product-design/)  
  Practice foundational techniques: silhouette sketches, shading, textures, and perspective.

- **Learn:** [Prototyping: Learn Eight Common Methods and Best Practices (Interaction Design Foundation)](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/prototyping-learn-eight-common-methods-and-best-practices#wizard_of_oz_prototypes-16)  
  Understand the role of low-fidelity sketches as part of an iterative prototyping strategy.

## 4. Learning CAD, CAM, and PDS Tools

Practical hands-on skills for digital modeling, manufacturing, and pattern design complement the conceptual work.

- **CAD:**  
  - [MangoJelly FreeCAD Tutorial Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkPlzmalvN4)  
  - [FreeCAD CAM Tutorial Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRcrFdYXHj4)  

- **PDS (Pattern Drafting and Sewing):**  
  - [Seamly 2D Pattern Drafting Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSfo0xp8QaM)  

---

## 5. Suggestions for Practice This Week

- Sketch several different concepts for a simple product idea, applying the sketching techniques.
- Build quick, rough prototypes with whatever materials you have to test specific questions.
- Use beginner CAD tutorials to model at least one design to prepare for 3D printing.
- Experiment with CAM path creation in FreeCAD or Fusion360 (if available) using your 3D model.
- For those interested, explore creating a simple pattern using Seamly.

## Keep in Mind

> "The more you make, the more—and the faster—you learn." — IDEO

Be ready to pivot, embrace failure, document what you learn, and focus on the purpose of each prototype: **to ask and answer questions** about your design.
