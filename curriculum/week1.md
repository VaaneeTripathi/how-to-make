# Week 1

For this week, **we will be working with cardboard, ice-cream sticks, paints, thermocol, and other similar supplies to be able to channel the child-like creativity that comes out in a playground. The idea is to have fun, think, and honestly let loose.** Making is so often guarded behind softwares and machines and things to pick up, and while that is needed sometimes one forgets that the fulfillment that drives making can be accessible even without these guardrails.

First and foremost, 

## What is a Makerspace? 

As said by Dale Dougherty of The Maker Mindset, in Design, Make, Play, it is a space where kids have the opportunity to make – a place where some tools, materials, and enough expertise can get them started.  These places, called makerspaces, share some aspects of the shop class, home economics class, the art studio and science labs.  In effect, a makerspace is a physical mash-up of different places that allows makers and projects to integrate these different kinds of skills.

Here is the whole article where I found this quote from: [Defining Makerspaces: What the Research Says](http://www.renovatedlearning.com/2015/04/02/defining-makerspaces-part-1/)

## History of Makerspaces

Here is how it has been talked about in this [National Inventors Hall of Fame White Paper](https://www.invent.org/sites/default/files/report/2020-09/How_to_Cultivate_a_Maker_Mindset_in_Your_Makerspace_White_Paper_FINAL.pdf), "All of us are makers. From artists painting a landscape, to architects designing a new house, to computer programmers developing the next revolutionary application, the need to create and improve the world around us is a part of being human. 

In the early 2000s, this inborn desire, paired with advances that made additive and subtractive technologies like 3D printers and laser cutters more affordable, initiated the "Maker Movement." According to Dale Dougherty, founder of both Make: Magazine and Maker Faire—the world's largest and most influential maker festival—one of the reasons this movement occurred was that people were growing tired of interacting with the world as consumers. Simply put, there was a desire for agency.

> "The maker movement has come about in part because of people's need to engage passionately with objects in ways that make them more than just consumers. Whether it's arts and science or crafts and engineering, they seem to belong together, connected by enthusiasm and a common passion."
>
> — Dale Dougherty

It did not take long for educators to see the potential benefits of developing curricula that promoted a hands-on approach to learning. They saw that creating designated spaces for children to explore and work together could naturally create a strong sense of community and collaboration in their students.

While the capabilities of new technology are incredible, the effectiveness of embracing play and using tools to learn and build have long been promoted. The work of renowned educator and mathematician Seymour Papert's educational theory, **constructionism**, strongly supports the effectiveness of learning by doing. In his famous grant application to the National Science Foundation in 1987, he explained this learning technique:

> "From constructivist theories of psychology, we take a view of learning as a reconstruction rather than as a transmission of knowledge. Then we extend the idea of manipulative materials to the idea that learning is most effective when part of an activity the learner experiences is constructing a meaningful product."
>
> — Seymour Papert, NSF Grant Application (1987)

Papert was concerned with the act of learning itself, and how making something creates a powerful cycle of self-directed learning.³ Central to the effectiveness of this method is its ability to empower students and encourage them to discover their own answers. Instead of waiting for an instructor to tell them what to do, students are given permission to take ownership of what they're learning. This type of meaningful education not only has incredible effects on classroom engagement but has the ability to fundamentally change what a child believes they can accomplish."

Now for this week, what are you supposed to do:

## Instructions

None. Nada. Zilch. Zero. 

Grab some things lying around, and go wild or stay tame or whatever. Have fun, don't think, channel the 5 year old you who just wanted to play with the cardboard boxes. Be creative or cliche, make something yourself or look something up. Just for God's sake, have fun and let loose. Let the process drive you.


Here is some material to go through before you begin:

1. **The Most Magnificent Thing**: This is a beautiful picture book about a little girl. It talks about certain things that I think all of us could use some reminding of from time to time. [Download PDF](/assets/mymostmagnificentthing.pdf)

2. **DIY Materials**: An article to understand the plethora of materials one can work with presented in a wonderful taxonomy! This is really nice to open up one's mind about what all is possible. This might not be completely relevant but I thought it was really cool so I added it. [The said article](https://www.aknamarquez.com/blog/2018/diymaterials)

Happy Making! <3
