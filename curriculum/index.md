## Curriculum

This site uses a `_modules` collection for weekly content. You can:

- Browse the modules at `/modules/` (collection index generated by the theme), or
- Use the links below to jump to specific weeks if present.

- [Modules collection](/modules/)

### Example weeks

- [Week 1](/modules/week-01/)
- [Week 2](/modules/week-02/)

If you prefer the URL to be `/curriculum/week-01/`, consider moving module files into a `curriculum/` folder or updating permalinks in the module files.
