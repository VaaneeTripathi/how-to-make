## Introduction - "How to Make"
___________________________________________________________________________________

Hello everyone! 

Welcome to **How to Make** - I designed this course as part of my summer internship at the Ashoka University Digital Makerspace as something we could offer to the student body. While, that might be delayed due to well, the universe not being in your corner, I decided to do the course myself. 

Now, that comes out as an interesting and convuluted sentences but it happened quite organically. I was in a not-nice place and my brain was having some zoomies about how much I know. I was feeling quite out-of-touch, disconnected from the space as well as the people. At the same time, there is and I believe always will be a part of me that is drawn to the art of making. I did try convincing myself that I could always do this when I graduate but then I compare the Makerspaces outside with the one I have immediate access to and they don't even come close. In some ways, this is a love letter to the place that built me as a college student, a researcher, a computer science student, and more importantly as a creative. And so, I am trying. Trying to get better, learn better, teach better, build better and trying to feel at ease at the space that was the first comforting place for me on campus. 

But, I digress. 

This course has been designed after going through about 20+ university makerspaces' courses and offers what I believe a structured way to something and someplace that can be rather intimidating to someone who just walks through the door. Makerspaces while as wonderful and filled with magic can be, they're also a LOT. The possibilities are endless but that also means knowing where to start can be hard. Well, this can be where you start. 

I am in no way saying that this the right way to do it,  any way that you feel comfortable and excited to start with, that is your way. So then in that case:

## Pre-requisites

1. You are at a Makerspace
2. You want to Make
3. You don't know where to start
4. You're overwhelmed because you don't know where to start and you are feeling lost and helpless like a little kitty who doesn't know how to stay but can't leave and cuddle with her softtoy because the place is too good and it has treats!!!!!

Welcome to the course! You're in the right place <3

## Timeline

TL:DR; There is no timeline

The course is divided into weeks because this is how I first envisioned it and because weekly tasks ensures consistency FOR me but you can decide the pace based on your availability, your schedule, classes, tests, friend's birthdays, bad mental health days, period cramp days. You do you.

And with that, you can go and explore this website. The About section is a great next place to go to. It will tell you a bit about the ashokan makerspace, contributing ways and guidelines, course outline, and how to approach the course. 

See you there!
