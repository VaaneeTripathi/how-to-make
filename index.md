Welcome to **How to Make** — a self-guided course and documentation space for learning practical making skills at the Ashokan Makerspace.

## Quick links

- [About](/about/) — Course information, policies and resources.
- [Curriculum](/curriculum/) — Weekly modules and lesson plans (modules collection at `/modules/`).
- [Author](/author/) — About the course author and contact.

## Start here

1. Read the [Course outline](/about/course-outline/).
2. Browse the weekly modules at [Modules collection](/modules/).
3. Join, contribute, and iterate — see [Contributing](/about/contributing/).

If you want the curriculum at `/curriculum/` instead of `/modules/`, I can help move module files or add permalinks to the module front matter.
